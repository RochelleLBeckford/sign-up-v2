    ~ making sure that the right data is going into the forms
    ~ for instance, if a form asks for an email how will it know that that data was entered
        ~ is checks this since a typical email syntax must have the @ symbol
    ~ forms mask text input when the input element has a "password" type
    ~ it can also be given a minlength and a maxlength attribute to help with validation
